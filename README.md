"I am delighted to commend the exceptional work of Shawna Tuli who lead the data analytics project for our SparkPoint program, which provides free financial coaching services for low-income families throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Shawna led the team successfully through complex data analytics that addressed critical questions we had about the effectiveness of the program model. We provided Shawna and her team with 15 years worth of historical data to help identify trends and actionable insights to inform future program decisions as we scale the program out to the rest of the State of California. Her dedication and expertise have been instrumental in evaluating the impact of our SparkPoint program. By meticulously guiding a team of analysts, Shawna provided invaluable insights into various aspects of our program model, shedding light on areas that can inform our future strategy and program refinement. Her leadership, analytical acumen, and collaborative spirit have not only enhanced our understanding of SparkPointâ€™s effectiveness but also set a high standard for future projects. We are deeply grateful for her remarkable contributions and the positive impact she has made on our organization." - Jacqueline Chan (United Way Bay Area Vice President, Impact Strategies)

"I had the pleasure of having Shawna as my manager for Accenture DSSG's pro-bono work with United Way Bay Area. From the start, Shawna's approachability and technical expertise stood out to me, helping our team tackle difficult statistical analyses coupled with complex historical data. She is also a gifted communicator - she explained technical concepts to non-technical client stakeholders in an accessible way and was a strong mentor to our team of junior data scientists and analysts. As a result, we successfully concluded the second phase of analysis with UWBA and have continued the partnership for a third phase of work. 

Shawna excelled both as a data science expert and a strong people-focused manager. She played a crucial role in the success of Accenture's pro-bono partnership with UWBA. I was honored to have this opportunity to work with Shawna." - Vivian Du (Accenture San Francisco Tech Architecture Analyst)
